# Sports-Data-Processing-Pipeline
## Project Overview
This project develops a robust data processing pipeline aimed at analyzing cricket match data. Leveraging Apache Spark and Apache Kafka, the pipeline manages real-time data ingestion to Amazon S3, and uses Kafka for efficient data distribution and management. The system transforms and validates data schemas, optimizes performance for fast querying, and uses SQL for deep analytics and visualizations of player performances and match trends.

## Features
- **Real-Time Data Ingestion**: Utilizes Apache Kafka to manage real-time data streams and ensures timely data ingestion from live cricket matches.
- **Data Transformation and Validation**: Apache Spark is used to ensure data quality and consistency through transformation and schema validation.
- **Query Optimization**: Enhances the speed of data querying and processing using optimized Spark jobs.
- **Analytics and Visualization**: Analyzes data using SQL queries and generates visual insights into cricket matches, focusing on player performance and emerging match trends.

## Technologies Used
- Apache Kafka
- Apache Spark
- Amazon S3
- SQL
- Visualization tools (such as Tableau, PowerBI, or Python libraries like Matplotlib/Seaborn)

### Prerequisites
